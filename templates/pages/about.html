    <p><strong>Compute Studio</strong> is an open-source utility for developers to freely share computational apps with users. </p>

    <p>Principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Freely share public apps and computations.</li>
      <li>Pay for your own resources, like compute, at cost.</li>
      <li>Sponsor resources for others if you'd like..</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A web-based graphical user interface for decisionmakers makes it easy to interact with C/S from the browser.</li>
      <li>The REST API enables developers to include C/S Apps in their own applications.</li>
      <li>Each user's personal library tracks their computations, including both inputs and results.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Under development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sharing and privacy features.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Planned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaboration features like commenting and editing.</li>
    </ul>
