# Compute Studio

**Compute Studio** is an open-source platform for sharing models and simulations. 

To see Compute Studio in action, visit [Compute.Studio](https://Compute.Studio).

Principles:
- Freely share models and simulations with the public.
- Pay for your own resources, like compute, at cost.
- Sponsor resources for others if you'd like.

Features:
- A web-based GUI for decisionmakers makes it easy to interact with models and simulations from the browser.
- The web API enables developers to include CS models in their own applications. 
- Personal libraries store simulations for users, including both inputs and results. 

Under development:
- Sharing and privacy features for simulations and models.
