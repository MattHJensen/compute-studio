# COMP

**COMP** is an open-source utility for sharing computational models.

To see COMP in action, visit [compmodels.com](https://www.compmodels.com).

Features:
- Developers may share their public models for free.
- Users pay for their own compute, at cost.
- Developers or their sponsors may also pay for users' compute.

Under development:

- Developers choose to share models privately, for a fee.
- Developers may share non-tabular output.

Planned:
- Users may use a REST API to run simulations and build GUI simulation pages.
- Users may upload and download simulation input files from the GUI.
