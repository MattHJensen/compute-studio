# Compute Studio

**Compute Studio** is an open-source utility for developers to freely share computational apps with users.

To see C/S in action, visit [Compute.Studio](https://Compute.Studio).

Principles:
- Freely share public apps and computations.
- Pay for your own resources, like compute, at cost.
- Sponsor resources for others if you'd like.

Features:
- A web-based graphical user interface for decisionmakers makes it easy to interact with C/S from the browser.
- The REST API enables developers to include C/S Apps in their own applications. 
- Each user's personal library tracks their computations, including both inputs and results. 

Under development:
- Sharing and privacy features. 

Planned:
- Collaboration features like commenting and editing.
