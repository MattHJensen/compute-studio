Hi all, I'm new to using React and Formik, and so far, I've had an awesome experience with these projects! 

The only issue that I've run into is that there's a significant lag on each key stroke for large forms (~500 fields). After reading this issue (https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/342) several times and trying the solutions posted there including using FastField, I am still stuck. It appears that each form field is re-rendered with each key stroke. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? Are there any debugging strategies I should try so that I can diagnose the issue?

Thanks in advance!
