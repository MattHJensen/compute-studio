# Publishing on COMP

This document describes how to publish a model on COMP. The COMP framework was built such that if a project meets all of the COMP criteria, then it can be plugged in with minimal custom work.

The documentation is split into three parts. The [first part](IOSCHEMA.md) documents the inputs and outputs schemas that are at the core of COMP's ability to display input forms, validate user input, and display outputs. The [second part](ENDPOINTS.md) documents the python functions that will be used by COMP to get data from and submit data to the project. The [third part](ENVIRONMENT.md) is where the project's installation process is defined.

Once you've taken a look at the documentation, fill out the [publishing information template](TEMPLATE.md). The template will ask you to provide a title and overview for the new COMP app, code snippets for the three python functions, and information describing how to install this project and its resource requirements. Send the completed guide to Hank at henrymdoupe@gmail.com. He'll review the provided information to make sure that all of the criteria has been met. If all of the criteria has been met, it will be deployed to COMP. If there are any issues, then he will work with you to resolve them. Once the model has been deployed, you will have the opportunity to test it out. Since COMP is an open-source website, you can check Hank's work to verify that the code was plugged in correctly.

If you have any questions about this guide, feel free to email Hank at henrymdoupe@gmail.com.
