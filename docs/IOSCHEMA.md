# Input-Output Schema

COMP relies on three primary JSON schemas: Meta-Parameters, Inputs, and Outputs. COMP uses them to derive the input form that the user will use, its own validation functionality, and the outputs page.

Meta-Parameters
--------------------------------

These are the "Control Parameters". They can be thought of as the parameters that other parameters depend on. For example, if the model has parameters that depend on which dataset is being used, a meta-parameter named `data_set` could be helfpul. This should be of the form:

```json
{
    "variable_name": {
        "title": "Variable Name",
        "default": "default value",
        "type": "int, boolean, string, date",
        "validators": {
            "range": {"min": "minvalue", "max": "maxvalue"},
            "choices": {"choices": ["list of choices"]}
        }
    }
}
```

Notes:
- Supported types are `"int"`, `"float"`, `"bool"`, `"str"`, and `"date"`. Parameters of type `"date"` expect the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
- Validators are optional. More validators will be added in the future.

Inputs
----------------

COMP was built with and will continue to support a JSON schema developed by the [Tax-Calculator][1] project. In the near future, COMP will use the [ParamProject Schema][2] as the preferred input schema. For now, here is the Tax-Calculator Schema:

```json
{
    "majorsection1": {
        "param_name1": {
            "long_name": "Human Readable Name of Parameter",
            "description": "Description of this parameter",
            "section_1": "Section of parameters that are like this one",
            "section_2": "Subsection of section 1",
            "notes": "More notes on this parameter.",
            "type": "type here",
            "value": "value here"
        }
    },
    "majorsection2": {
    }
}
```

Notes:
- The major sections can be thought of as broad categories of input parameters. A baseball model may break up its inputs into Hitting, Pitching, and Fielding major sections.
- Supported types are `"int"`, `"float"`, `"bool"`, `"str"`, and `"date"`. Parameters of type `"date"` expect the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.

Outputs
------------

Currently, tables are the only supported media that can be served. In the future, COMP will serve media such as pictures and charts.

Upstream projects can specify downloadable content such as CSVs in addition to the rendered content.

A tag system is used to organize the outputs. For example, a baseball model might produce outputs for each of baseball's two leagues and have tags: `{"league": "american"}` and `{"league": "national"}`. There can be multiple levels of tags. Continuing the previous example, there could be a muti-level tag `{"league": "american", "team": "yankees"}` or `{"league": national", "team": "braves"}`.

There are two types of outputs. One type is "Aggregate Outputs." These will be displayed at the top of the outputs page. These should be used when the result of each task needs to be combined into a single output. A postprocess function will be called once each task has completed, and that is where the outputs will be combined.

The other type is "Outputs. Each of these outputs is generated by a single task and thus, do not need to be combined in a postprocess function. A `dimension` attribute needs to be specified for each of these outputs. This attribute should correspond to each task that is run by the model. For example, a baseball model that runs on each season over a ten year period will have a dimension attribute named `"Season"` and a set of outputs that corresponds to each of those seasons.

The Outputs Schema:

```json
{
    "aggr_outputs": [
        {
            "tags": {"category": "a category"},
            "title": "Title to be displayed",
            "downloadable": [
                {
                    "filename": "filename.csv",
                    "text": "data here"
                },
            ],
            "renderable": "HTML table to render"
        }
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "tags": {"category": "a category", "subcategory": "a subcategory"},
            "dimension": "Dimension corresponding to the task producing this output",
            "title": "Title to be displayed (may want to include dimension)",
            "downloadable": [
                {
                    "filename": "filename.csv",
                    "text": "data here"
                },
            ],
            "renderable": "HTML table to render"
        },
    ],
    "meta": {
        "task_times": ["list of task times in seconds"],
        "version": "model version, e.g. 1.1.0"
    }
}
```
